Driving Dingo
==============

Dingo ships with a game controller that can be used for teleoperation.  By default this is a PS4 controller, though
other controllers can also be used.

.. Warning::

  Dingo can move fast enough to cause physical damage to itself or its surroundings if driven irresponsibly.

  We strongly recommend driving in normal (slow) mode first, and only enabling turbo in large, open areas that are free
  of people and obstacles.

  When driving a physical robot always make sure you have a clear line of sight to the robot.  In case of emergency,
  release both L1 and R1 on the controller to stop the robot immediately.

Dingo will ship with its controller pre-paired, but if you need to re-pair your controller, follow the instructions
:doc:`here <controllers>`.

Driving Dingo-D
----------------

To drive the Dingo-D, Axis 0 controls the robot's steering, Axis 1 controls the forward/backward velocity,
and buttons 4 and 5 act as enable & enable-turbo respectively.  On common controllers these correspond to the following
physical controls:

============= ==================================== ===== ===== ========= ===================================
Axis/Button   Physical Input                       PS4   F710  Xbox One  Action
============= ==================================== ===== ===== ========= ===================================
Axis 0        Left thumb stick horizontal          LJ    LJ    LJ        Drive forward/backward
Axis 1        Left thumb stick vertical            LJ    LJ    LJ        Rotate
Button 4      Left shoulder button or trigger      L1    LB    LB        Enable normal speed
Button 5      Right shoulder button or trigger     R1    RB    RB        Enable turbo
============= ==================================== ===== ===== ========= ===================================

You must hold either Button 4 or Button 5 at all times while driving the robot.

Driving Dingo-O
----------------

To drive the Dingo-O, Axis 0 controls the robot's steering, Axis 1 controls the robot's left/right translation,
and Axis 2 controls the robot's steering.  Buttons 4 and 5 act as enable and enable-turbo respectively. On common
controllers these correspond to the following physical controls:

============= ==================================== ===== ===== ========= ===================================
Axis/Button   Physical Input                       PS4   F710  Xbox One  Action
============= ==================================== ===== ===== ========= ===================================
Axis 0        Left thumb stick horizontal          LJ    LJ    LJ        Drive forward/backward
Axis 1        Left thumb stick vertical            LJ    LJ    LJ        Drive left/right
Axis 2        Right thumb stick horizontal         RJ    RJ    RJ        Rotate
Button 4      Left shoulder button or trigger      L1    LB    LB        Enable normal speed
Button 5      Right shoulder button or trigger     R1    RB    RB        Enable turbo
============= ==================================== ===== ===== ========= ===================================

You must hold either Button 4 or Button 5 at all times while driving the robot.
